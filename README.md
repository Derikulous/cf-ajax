# Ajax Resource based on Railscast #  136

## RailsCasts Episode #136: jQuery & Ajax (revised)

This app is a step-by-step from Railscast #136 so that I can learn about AJAX calls in Rails.

Basics:
1) Create 4 .js.erb files for Update, New, Update, and Destroy
2) update the tasks controller to respond to the new .js task views.
3) add remote: true links in the .html.erb files
4) Add coffeescript language to respond to actions in the view
